# Snap-SVG-Starter

A basic guide for Snap SVG library functionalities focusing on drag events and transformations
You can find the latest version of the Snap SVG library [here](http://snapsvg.io/)

After spending a lot of time trying to figure out how to use the Snap SVG library, I decided to create a basic guide for myself and others to use as a reference. This guide focuses on how to use drag events to apply transformations to SVG elements.

## LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS

One thing I still cannot solve is to make the Skewing transformations works nicely with the other types. Currently if Skew is applied as the last step, no problem. But if it is applied before other transformations, it will mess up the other transformations. I am still trying to figure out how to solve this problem.
